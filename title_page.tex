\begin{closing}{Data and code availability}
Authors should direct readers to an open access repository where data and code used in the study are made available. Zenodo, figshare, and Dryad are examples of repositories where authors can archive their data and code. Citations for datasets and codes should be included in the references. Github is not considered a persistent repository, and we encourage authors to archive a snapshot of any github hosted code on zenodo.
